    <p style="text-align: left">The most notable and accomplished Bulldogs would go on to be immortalized and their jersey numbers would never be worn again. Frank Sinkwich was a 2-time All-American and the first Heisman Trophy winner at the University of Georgia and the Southeastern Conference. Sinkwich would also lead Georgia to its first claimed National Championship in 1942. Herschel Walker, considered one of the best college football players of all-time, is a 3-time All-American and Heisman Trophy winner. As a first-year student, Walker would lead the Bulldogs to a National Championship and go on to hold many rushing records over his career. Theron Sapp, also known as the Drought Breaker, played a vital role in overcoming Georgia's rivals. Sapp would go on to earn All-SEC honors as a fullback. Charley Trippi, known for his versatility, played practically every position on the field. He would help Georgia win the National Championship in 1942 as the Rose Bowl MVP. Trippi would go on to become an All-American, win the Maxwell Award, and the SEC Player of the Year. Frank Sinkwich, Herschel Walker, and Charley Trippi would all go on to be inducted in the College Football Hall of Fame.</p>

    <h2>Rivalries</h2>
        <p>The Georgia Bulldogs have many storied rivalries. The "Deep South's Oldest Rivalry" against the Auburn Tigers date back to their inaugural season in 1892. And the legendary "Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate" rivalry versus the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets would kick off the following year in 1893. Arguably their biggest rivalry started back in the early 1900's against the Florida Gators. The game has been played every year in Jacksonville, FL since 1933. It has come to be known as the "World's Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party". Of the eight rivalry games that Georgia participates in, they lead their all-time series in seven of them.</p>
